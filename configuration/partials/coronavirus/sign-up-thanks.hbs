<p>
  Thank you for your interest in volunteering!
</p>
<p>
  Over the coming weeks, we’ll send you email updates to let you know what specific opportunities there are to help organisations in your community.
</p>
<p>
  There are so many offers of help, it might not be possible to find a role for everyone, so do not be discouraged if you don’t hear about any suitable opportunities immediately. Over time, there will be more ways to help.

  Remember you are making a contribution to keeping everyone safe by staying at home and following <a href="https://nhsinform.scot/coronavirus">government guidelines</a>.
